#Explanation:
What the Code Does:
This code implements a simple e-commerce product management system in PHP. It includes classes for products, a repository to manage the collection of products, and a manager to interact with the system (e.g., creating, displaying, updating, and deleting products).

Product Class: Represents a generic product with properties like id, name, price, and category.
Electronics Class: Inherits from Product and adds a specific property, warrantyPeriod, to handle electronics products.
ProductRepository: Manages the collection of products, providing methods to add, remove, sort, and filter products.
ProductManager: Provides a user-facing interface to interact with the product repository, allowing users to perform CRUD operations.
Why I Wrote This Code:
The goal was to create a reusable and extensible system for managing different types of products in an e-commerce environment. By using OOP principles, the code is organized, maintainable, and easily extendable to accommodate new product types or additional features.

What Problem It Solves:
This code solves the problem of managing products in a structured way, including handling different product types, performing common operations like sorting and filtering, and ensuring the codebase is scalable as the project grows. It also demonstrates good coding practices, such as separation of concerns, encapsulation, and reusability.

This example showcases your ability to design and implement a larger-scale application with clear architecture, which is a crucial skill in professional development.
